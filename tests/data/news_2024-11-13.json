We also gave it a full visual overhaul, which means your favorite bleak Eastern European train yard is now 60% cloudier. With a chance of rain? We guarantee it.\n\nSo queue up and get ready to master the newest version of one of Counter-Strike's most iconic maps. Train is now available in casual and competitive game modes.\n\n[h3]Overpass Updates and New Community Maps[/h3]\n\n[img]https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/9f20d9e437f8ae93c6f276546599860361b0a50b.png[/img]\nOverpass has received a number of updates based on community feedback, and we're adding four new community maps to the game. Basalt returns to Counter-Strike 2 alongside Edin in casual and competitive game modes, and Palais and Whistle have been added to Wingman.\n",
